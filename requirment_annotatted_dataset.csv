Robert Gilmore,1.0 out of 5 stars,When iPhone app connects strange messages appear,Initially connecting an iPhone using the Screen Mirroring companion App to the Fire Stick Screen Mirroring App the connection works but after a couple of minutes a message appears on the TV that there is an error described as unauthorized use.

Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,NEEDS SOME WORK!!,"When I opened the app it came up with a message, something about how I liked the app.  Since I hadn't looked at it yet I couldn't say.  After I looked at the app and can see it has some glitches I could no longer get the ""what did I think of the app"".  When I tried to access a recipe that was offered from the recipe picture pages a different recipe would come up - not the one I asked to see.  After doing this numerous times with various recipes pictured I have determined that this definitely ""Needs some work"".  Maybe it can stay on my apps, but I don't know if I'll bother using it it I can't access a particular recipe.  And, thanks for putting the How do you like this app feature upon the first opening of the app.  How did I know that it doesn't exactly work as advertised.  Not impressed.  Also, don't like the new Foodnetwork style.  Printing is WAY too big.  Like I don't need to use 1/4 page of a piece of paper for the title of the recipe only.  That, with all the ""competition cooking"" shows, and I'm about to write Foodnetwork off of my radar.",issue

I selected the trial again, but now was automatically signed up for a month ($77). Be aware that Fubo's user interface is tricky and will have you signing up for a month that you probably don't even want. I called customer service and they wouldn't reverse the charges.",feature

G. Parnell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Several things to make me hate Fubo - FOREVER,"Right off the bat, the highest resolution this service offered for PC was 720p. That was enough for me to cancel, which I did immediately. Then I though maybe the resolution might be higher on my smart TV. Guess what? I never found out. Because when you cancel your subscription, Fubo locks you out immediately. So much for a free trial. You only get a free week if they get to keep your subscription intact. BOGUS MAN! Nobody does that. I mean like literally NOBODY else does that. I wanted to try this service without being stuck paying the extremely high subscription. I wanted to TRY the service. Fubo has no interest in me trying it. They want me to pay. So what if the first week is free - they want the big money. So they can suck it. And suck it hard. I will never try Fubo ever again. My 2 minute experience was woeful enough, but it was long enough to see how they run their business. Jackass mofos. 720p laughin my buttocks off.The stupid thing is, I am trying really hard to find a solution to cutting the cable company cord. I've been trying various things and keep coming up with the stiff end of these provider's business practices. Add Fubo to that list. I'm probably gonna have to end up with YouTube TV which literally makes me wanna cry.  I am willing to pay a monthly fee, but I literally HATE TV SHOWS! All I want is access to sports, without having 14 different subscriptions. Oh well. Sports bar. Friend's house. Pirate site hahahahahaha. Surely in a few more years there will be valid solutions for sports fans. Fubo will certainly never get my money.",feature

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",feature

There was no DCP7065 driver, so the MayDay technician, knowing that higher number drivers are supposed to be backward compatible, tried the next higher driver, but no luck. That driver printed a boatload of blank pages, and trying to use the Brother driver did not work, and the iPrint app was not available from Chrome for some weird reason.The tech helped me with a workaround. Save the file as a PDF, then print the PDF. The iPrint driver does work woth the DCP7065. Hallelujah.",issue

What was wrong with keeping that, PLUS the app. if that's what someone wanted? Everything gets more and more complicated and more difficult to use.

They told me to install and reinstall, which I did (about 10 times) and it still didn't work, still asked for the upgrade, and then they wanted my receipt from Amazon.  Also, I got a different person each time.  Stay away!",issue

Mr Wizard,1.0 out of 5 stars,BOY DO I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE,"CAPITALIZATION in this review is NOT screaming ... just highlighting ...My initial ""review to myself"" was positive, when I tested a plain, short ""Word"" style document. It seemed to work just fine, and NOBODY releases software that doesn't work do they? snort!!! So I bought the program, and BOY! am I SORRY! that I did so, because I can now no longer get a refund as I have struggled SO long and SO hard, trying to make this piece of software do the simplest tasks.There is SO much of this app that either just plain does not work, or has VERY limited functionality, or does not work quite right, that I CANNOT in good conscience recommend this app to ANYONE for ANY reason.I have written to Support twice, and beyond the ""We have received your request..."" email notice, I have received NO response whatsoever to my request for assistance or clarification.The so called HELP system is more a list of what the menu options are than they are instructions on how to use this app. As a help system, it is WOEFULLY, and PITIFULLY inadequate. So mix the fact that parts of it, despite being available to the user, just do not work, the lack of reliable support and the lack of a comprehensive help system, and you get a miserable, FAILED attempt at a piece of software that should not have gone to market for a SIGNIFICANT additional period of time for development.And when I bought this, my ONLY option was a subscription so that I have to pay for it again, and AGAIN, EVERY year. What the heck happened to just being able to BUY a piece of software?These people need a couple of million bucks of investment money so that they can do some more development on this software so that it WORKS, and works COMPLETELY before they start selling it. As it stands, it needs a LOT more development. While SOME small parts of it DO work, it is NOT a replacement for microsoft office. There is just too much of it that does not work to warrant buying this app.I just CANNOT imagine a greater waste of money. This is probably THE worst purhase that I have EVER made online.",issue

Stupid Annoying marketing). I used it a few times a day to see if it was what I wanted, because I do not like the AMAZON WPS product included in my FIRE HDX 7 Tablet at all. After about a week or so, Developer offered the Full-Pro version, for half price, so I purchased it.The only thing that I haven't been able to find is How To Send and Store all my files  to Amazon Prime Cloud, which I desire, because the HDX that I have only allows internal total user storage up to about 11.5GB. Maybe the feature is in the APP somewhere and I just haven't found it yet...

Take care to pay for Skype services with an active credit card that handles disputes professionally. DO NOT use PayPal or bank account debits.Last March, I downloaded an app release by Skype for my Windows Phone. It did not work. Skype initially denied the existence of such an app. Finally, it acknowledged that it did not work properly.PayPal said my payment covered a service and not refundable. Skype ignored repeated request using email (no phone for a telephony provider?)Just today, pursuing use for my Kindle Fire, I found that my initial deposit was forfeit for inactivity. I used chat to request reinstatement. The representative seemed unable to extract information despite a ""Dick & Jane"" narrative, asking off-base questions and even, well into the conversation, requesting my screen name -- provided on the transcript. It became apparent that, if not illiterate, the representative was trained to deflect callers and outlast any caller's attempt at redress.",issue

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Volume problems,"Kindle Fire 8.9"" HD. Installed Skype for tablet from the Kindle App Store. Already had a Skype account on my computer so account setup was not an issue. Audio volume is buggered. The start up sound is fine. The ring sound is low and call volume is very low. This appears to be a software problem in Skype. They need to fix this problem.THe video quality is very good with a good wi-fi connection. The microphone works well and does not appear to pick up too much surrounding noise. The person I was talking to said that the volume was fine on their end.When Skype corrects the volume problem, this will be a 5 star application. Until then 3 stars at most.A delete and second install seems to have cured the volume problem and Skype now works well.",issue

At least I didn't pay for the whole year up front, I guess. Many of the reviews about Skype I have read were posted by folds who signed up for the entire year!

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",feature

ijess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.",issue

What bothers me is since the updates it's like this program isn't even made for my kindle,crash crash crash crash crash. Thats the story of my life nowadays. You pretty much cannot access any other program while it's running even though it keeps it running in a pic in pic screen in the corner. If you do it will......whats that folks?......CRASH. Absolutely the most useless program on the planet. I plan to sell my kindle back to amazon as soon as I get home for the measily 56 bucks they are offering after my 7 months of ownership and I am buying a IPAD thats right I said it. At least I know face time is reliable and wont drop after 1 to two seconds of use. This is truely a pathetic product and should be an embarassment to amazon.

Rihanna Wallace,1.0 out of 5 stars,Update Ruined Skype,"Since Skype has been updated I've faced a bunch of problems. One problem is that the volume is high, it doesn't matter if I put the volume on zero I can still hear the person on the other line loudly. Another problem that I have is that as soon as you click on the app it signs in automatically. If someone was to click on my Skype they would be able to access my messages and contacts immediately.  I want my privacy. Another problem is that it continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minutes it's working and the next it's sending you a message that says ""Skype is not responding would you like to close it"" if you say yes it closes and if you don't the message will continue to pop up. Before the update I also noticed that Skype would just hang up my calls and I thought it was my internet connection but after reading numerous reviews I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem. Skype needs to be fixed immediately. The company should fix all the glitches before putting it back in the Appstore.",issue

Worked wonderful!  I had no problems whatsoever getting it working.  I already had a Skype account that I used on my desktop computer.  Logged in. D-I-L called and I answered with video...  was wonderful.  Good quality picture.  She sent me photos via Skype at the same time that we were video chatting.  They came through just fine.

K Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just What I Need,"Works just like a phone. All you have to do is sign up. It will then ask for ur your phone number in which then  the app will give u a new one to use on your tablet. I wasnt really paying attention to see if you can get your tablet number without having a phone number but I think you can. Although you have limited usage for calling through credit, the texting is unlimited. Plus you can easily get some free credits by watching ad videos for 1 or 2 credits. Sometimes it double the credits on certain days. A credit counts for 1 minute and u have 10 starting out.  Its syncs perfectly with contactsas as well. No problems here, but I would like to have some more customizable features. Like the theme color being purple and etc. My number reason for getting this app is because my mom refuses to get me a smart phone so I have a tracfone. I was able to send messages to other tracfone as well but it is compatible with all phones. I use this app on my kindle hdx and I will hope that you consider giving this app a try.",user_experience

My grandmother is in another state, and I'm lucky to see her once a year, and call her once a week. So, why not use my kindle and text her? I tried many apps, but, they either, had bugs and viruses, or cost money. The credits are an issue, but videos and offers help with that. I have over 1,000 credits,all from doing offers. The sms and texting work amazing. All you have to do is click on new message and type in the phone number. One problem I see is that once you text one person to much, which took me a year to accomplish, they won't let you anymore. But, anyhow, you CAN change the name of the person, and their picture. Just go to contacts, ( a different app) and put the phone number into a contact, name them, and give them a picture. It should update when you next power off and on your device.",user_experience

The ads are 1-2 lines w/logo and a month passes there are offers to delete them: for a one time annual fee,  or monthly fee, or combo annual fee includes telephone reserve. It does not show names only phone numbers, maybe a future feature. There are choices of ring chimes, and it keeps chiming till you get it (a feature I love).

I suppose in the days of two-step verifications, that means I won't be able to function online any more. I certainly won't choose to deal with a company that lies about its price. That should not be allowed, and Amazon should remove their app from the Fire store. False advertising is wrong. Poor value is wrong. I have no idea why there are positive reviews here.

I spent more time looking at a black loading screen than I did actually learning. If you want an app that will teach you a language, I suggest the ones I mentioned above. They're similar in style, but each a bit different to cater to different learning styles, and both are WAAAAY better than Rosetta stone.

The writing exercises are not supported on mobile devices, at least on FireOS and Android. No idea about IOS.You get one lesson free as a demo, then to continue you must subscribe. Rosetta Stone is not cheap, but their pricing model has changed recently and it's not as expensive as it was when I first looked at it years ago. I've used Duolingo and Memrise and I like them both very much, but I prefer Rosetta Stone's method and find it more effective for my learning style.

It's main downfall for me (and perhaps I just didn't know where to look) was there is no list of the varied conjugations (soy eres es somos son) that allows you to study the various verb and word forms before you are just thrown into the water to learn to swim.

I needed to see the words, to see how they fit into sentences, and to help build up a decent vocabulary. Now, 25 years later, in an effort to keep up my rusty French, I started DuoLingo and am astounded at the improvement in my comprehension and vocabulary. A lot of useful words are introduced early on and one must listen to them, read them, write them and use them in sentences. This system is fun to use and it clearly will teach one a language.

Bexcat,3.0 out of 5 stars,Helpful but can be irritating,"Good app for free but I think it needs some development work...I can already speak Spanish but some of the translations are irritating in that there are so few alternatives allowed and the woman speaks South American Spanish so the machine does not accept some Castillian Spanish words and constantly wants you to use formal you (ustedes) which is normal in S.America but not in Spain.  Also sometimes only American English not British is accepted. The most irritating thing for a translator is that some of the translations are too literal or even inaccurate...nobody in Spanish says Yo quiero...they say Quiero. From a language point of view the grammar translation method is actually very old and many of the sentences may well not be useful.  All this said, it is quite fun to play with and somewhat addictive. Will be trying some other languages!",issue

Pyrien,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun~,"So far, I'm really enjoying the way this app submerses you into the language and forces you to remember how the verb in particular ends rather than list is like language classes do. The app helped me learn the languages faster than it did with an actual teacher. The learning is personal and if you fail out of the lesson, you have to start that lesson over and I like this since the questions aren't in the same order, so it's not totally just memorize the right answer to pass. You're still learning and it's great!My only complaint is, I took three years of French and started using the French portion to get better at my listening skills, since that's where I do poorly, and sometimes the translations are wrong, or vastly differ from what I learned. For example the app teaches you instantly that jolie and joli mean lovely or nice, which in fact the word means 'pretty'. I know it's similar, but it threw me off since 'bonne' was also an option and that fits 'nice' better than 'jolie' does... Just my opinion...Anyway, once I got passed that, the French portion became easier and I was able to skip ahead using the skip ahead feature so if you know basics, you're not stuck completely relearning them!So far, this is the best learning tool I've found to help me learn new languages and I would really love to see more languages added~!!",issue

It gives you lessons you need to complete, then sort of a practice test at the end of each group of lessons, then you can test out after the group of lessons as well. I have really enjoyed this program. I am not speaking fluently yet, but I am having a great time learning. J'aime Duolingo!",user_experience

Sometimes the conversation gets a bit off track even if it is interesting.

Now, there's only a big empty box with a small word.3. I think it used to have more chances for the user to repeat a phrase (and try to say it correctly!).Despite these minor issues, this is a great little motivator for language learning.

What I mean is not that they don't have enough vocab but rather they don't provide an easy list for each section of learned words. I find it really helpful when there is a reference sheet.

craftymama,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A little lacking, but otherwise good.","I originally downloaded this app to help me brush up on my French, which is pretty rusty after 15 years of little to no use, and my Spanish, which is just a little rusty after a year of little to no use. I am somewhat pleased with this app. I don't like it as much as I like my French and Spanish classes, but as far as a language tutor, it's great. The only thing lacking in this app is that it doesn't explain the conjugations of verbs with respect to pronouns. For instance--and I'm going to use Spanish as an example here--it doesn't explain why the verb 'ser' gets conjugated to 'eres' when you say ""tu eres,"" or why it gets conjugated to 'somos' when you say, ""nosotros somos."" If it explained the process of conjugation for each language, that would make the app SO MUCH better and also help newbies have a fuller understanding of the language they are trying to learn. Anyone who doesn't know the first thing about other languages is going to think that this app is great, but if you are like me and you have had formal classes before, you will know that this app is seriously lacking. Formal classes give you the fundamental principles of the language to help you, and one of those fundamentals is learning conjugation so that you will not only understand what you're saying, but WHY you're saying it that way. I know this app isn't the same as a formal class, but if the developers are going to market it as an alternative to expensive formal classes, then they need to at least offer better teaching tools within the app.",issue

There are other terrific apps, but they get so dry it is difficult to stay interested. I use this on my Kindle Fire, my Samsung TabA, and my iPhone. There are subtle differences but the brilliant content is the same. There are a few things that pair nicely with Duolingo but this should be the one you go to for the real deal.

Loren Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best language-learning apps I've seen so far,"This is an excellent app and an excellent website. I've been a language learner for over 40 years, and Duolingo is one of the best facilitators I've seen. It combines some of the best aspects of its predecessors, like Rosetta and Mango, but it's free (!), and it's very entertaining (it keeps you translating sentences like ""I'm a horse, and I speak English""), and it reminds you when you need refresher work. I've only been using it for a short time, but it's excellent for learning the bones of a language. I don't think it's for the weekend traveler; it doesn't give you the hello/how are you stuff. It concentrates on vocabulary and grammar (in a fun non-schoolroom way). So, if you just want to learn Please and Thank you and How are you?, buy a phrasebook. If you're going to be in Norway / Spain / France / Germany for a month or so, try Duolingo. It will entertain you and educate you, and give you what you need.",user_experience

They have recipes to fit everyoneÃ¢â¬â¢s taste even the really picky ones. I love the fact that a lot of the recipes are rated so you can see what people like and didnÃ¢â¬â¢t like about the recipes.During the live feature if you catch one during the time itÃ¢â¬â¢s actually live (schedules are provided) you can ask questions wit the Q&A button and if you are lucky the host will answer it.

But you know you will slack on backing this up regularly, offline. So much management. Additionally the larger your recipe stash gets, the more space is eaten up on your device.  Also don't expect there to be sync'ing between your phone and tablet for example, since there is no cloud storage or account to login to and sync.I will save and revisit this app at a later date.

Cheryl,3.0 out of 5 stars,I USED to love this app,"Up until today, I rated this app as 4 or 5 stars.  I loved it for my Kindle Fire and started using it almost exclusively when cooking.  Today, however, when I went to open my recipes, it wouldn't open.  Instead, it showed a message saying that all my recipes were there waiting for me and I could see them just as soon as I upgraded the app!I had already decided that I didn't want to upgrade because I had seen that the upgrade changed the permissions, adding some more chancy ones that I saw no need for.  So now they are holding my recipes hostage unless I upgrade to the new permissions!This wouldn't be so bad if all I had in there were recipes I'd imported from the net, but there were several I'd developed myself and I really hate to lose them.  But I also don't like giving into blackmail.Update 11/25/12 - I've upgraded my review from 2 to 3 stars. The company was responsive to our dislike of some of the permissions and backed off a bit and I gave in and upgraded because I really like this app.  I love having all my recipes with me on my Kindle Fire and not having to print recipes from the net when I want to use them. NICE!I DO NOT like the ads they've added.  I understand they need to make money, but personally, I would rather just pay for the app than have the ads. This and concern about permissions is why I still rate this app as 3 rather than 5 star.",issue

rZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,ChefTap gets it right!,I love this app.  It works perfectly on my kindleFire.  Easily and flawlessly copies recipes from various sources on the web -- even from cooking blogs where there is a lot of nonrecipe verbiage.  Also appreciate the step-by-step instructions with split screen displaying ingredients on one side and instructions on the other.  Ability to edit recipes and categorize/tag each recipe according to preferences is another bonus.  All around impressive!  Many thanks to the creators!  ChefTap is already one of my most useful and favorite apps.,user_experience

bookprincess,5.0 out of 5 stars,this chef loves it!,"I am astounded that there are not more reviews on this app! As a chef it is wonderful for keeping, collecting, and tweaking my recipes. As a homecook, it is great to have at your fingertips. The sync-ability to the popular allrecipes and epicurious is an added bonus. So thankful this is free.",user_experience
Elizabeth A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,$20 PER YEAR AND Different PRO features for different platforms? No thanks,"I'm very disappointed in this. This has great reviews, but it's really not all that great. I registered on my kindle. I went to the website to input all my recipes (there's only about 50, so I have room on the free account) from my browser bookmarks. But the ""CLIP"" feature on the website is only for PRO users. But I can enter them in all by hand. On the Kindle app, it's opposite. The CLIP feature is free and the manual entry is a PRO feature. So now, what I wanted it for, it's useless unless I want to spend a few hours inputting everything. There's no reason why the PRO features should be different from one platform to the next if you're offering a sync method to begin with. On top of all of that, I didn't realize it was $20 A YEAR. That's way too much when my good old card holder and recipe cards have barely cost $20 in TEN YEARS.",user_experience
Dave B,1.0 out of 5 stars,Support Has Gone Downhill,"I was an early, and enthusiastic user of this app, and encouraged many of my friends and family to use this app...However, of late, the technical support has really declined...I've also had an issue where the recipe count doesn't match between  my Android device and the website...I was finally  told that it isn't they don't want to fix it, but ""t's not that I can't fix it; It's that I'm at the end of a major feature development cycle (meal planning and menus) and all fixes going forward will be applied to the that version of ChefTap.""...I responded back to this on 05/31/19 asking when this was going to occur, but have yet to get any kind of response back...Why should I use (and pay) for an app when I can't get a timely response to inquiries/questions or issue?",issue
M. Canales,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful App,"I LOVE this app.  It makes my life so much easier.  There are a few quirks here and there but the folks at Chef Tap truly want to hear about any issues and they actually respond and do their best to fix them right away or as soon as possible.  As for people who complain about having to pay for the app after clipping so many recipes, it is absolutely worth it. The price is nominal if you think about it and you get so much for your money.  I can scale recipes reducing human error, I can create shopping lists and a 'make list' so I don't forget what I wanted to fix.  I have lost beloved recipes in my home countless times... well no more.  They are right there on my phone and computer AND they are organized.  You can search for things in countless ways if you use the tags.  I just can't say enough about this app.  It is free to try and if you don't like all of the convenience and organization it can bring to your life then you don't have to buy it.  But for those of us that need it, it is well worth the current $1.60 per month.  Highly recommend!",user_experience

I've yet to find a glitch.  Only problem is, I just got an iPad and so far I do not see that there is an app for Apple!  Please help I must have this app!",user_experience
Donna OBrien,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!,"I tried several different recipe apps until my hubby found Chef Tap. I quit looking at that point! Without a doubt this is the best recipe app available today.Pros: Haven't found a site yet that I could not download from, love the ""+/- text size"", ease in which one can find & edit stored recipes, etc. I could go on and on...there is that much to love about this app!

Mandyjo,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST ANDROID RECIPE APP EVER!,"I've been downloading recipe apps for three years now, testing them all, and this one is MAGIC. It can read just about any imported, copied, scanned, typed recipe without having to edit so much. just wish they had access editing on computer and one for Mac. that would be awesome. also I  suggest Grocery list imports with stores, prices and coupons. like..hint, hint GroceryIQ?  maybe! good work. works on LG phones, Samsung smartphones, and my Acer tab. all since great and have NEVER LOST ONE RECIPE.",user_experience
John B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Asus Transformer TF101,"the sole reason i purchased a tablet was to organize my hundreds of recipes. i discovered cheftap & installed it immediately. after several updates, it runs fantastic. creators are always fine-tuning it & making it better. you cannot manually input your own recipes but you merely save recipes you find online...all you have to do is a couple of taps & the recipe is saved forever. there are other apps where you can input personal recipes. overall, i love this app.",user_experience
smllchng,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Recipe Storage App out there for Android,"This is an amazing App. Have tried several recipe storage apps, and none gave me what I wanted...to enter in my own recipes or sync with a website, and then be able to edit it as needed. Not only was it pretty good at transferring during the sync...but they have the best customer service. Any problem I had, I emailed them and within less than 24 hours I had an answer and lots of additional tips. Thanks for being so great!!!",user_experience
Heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,"I use this app alongside Pinterest to find new recipes and have them put into a format that is easy to read while I'm preparing meals in the kitchen! Love how you can change text size, and add your own images! BUT I would LOVE to be able to add recipes via a browser interface or desktop app that would sync with the app on my tablet.

What I mean is that I ran it on my fire tv stick specifically to watch the superbowl and the pre-game stuff leading up to it. The audio was multiple seconds behind the video which made it difficult because entire sentences where spoke before I actually heard them.  I thought maybe if I restart that would clear it up. Sadly no. The app was bad enough I just went ahead and used my over the air antenna instead. I wanted this app to work well. But it did not. I cannot recommend it at this time as a result. I suggest steer clear of this application. It was made available for the superbowl and failed.,issue

Tony DeLaGrange,1.0 out of 5 stars,is Fox Sports Go so I can watch my favorite baseball team,"Just purchased new Amazon FireTV Stick and first app I installed is Fox Sports Go so I can watch my favorite baseball team. Unfortunately, regardless of what live game or show I watch on this app, it consistently freezes and then continues and repeats that process, at least once or twice a minute. I can run Fox Sports Go app on my iPhone connected to the same WiFi router and it works without ever freezing or delay. I have 100Mb fiber connection with AT&T and a NightHawk wireless router. I get consistent download speeds of ~125Mb and under 10ms for latency, so its not the network (first thing that is blamed). I've watched shows on Amazon Prime on the same FireTV stick without any issues. I've restarted the FireTV stick, and even re-installed the Fox Sports Go app, no change.",issue

Chuck Echweild,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A good start on an NBC sports app, but with plenty of room for improvement.","The NBC sports app is a huge improvement over the prime-time coverage, but the app still needs work. It can be difficult to navigate among events; the olympics ended up being a single string of several thousand individual events, with no search option, and a paucity of informative labeling. To recognize the individual sports you had to identify the thumbnail image -- there was no accompanying text describing the event. Playback was generally good, with nice high resolution imagery, but from time to time the feed would fail or compression artifacts would interfere. I don't have any trouble with this streaming most video, so I have to assume it is the app or (more likely) the back-side server. There is no option to watch an event part way and then return to it at the same point, and searching and scrolling functions are awkward. Still, despite these problems, this is how I chose to watch the Olympics; the prime time broadcast is dead to me.",issue

Tony K,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great app to use with IP cameras as baby monitor,We purchased this app to use with our IP camera baby monitors and it works pretty well.  It is a little cumbersome to program the camera settings but the app works great otherwise.  It lets you choose from a couple different display layouts but we always use the side by side.  The refresh rate is quick enough that we can usually see what's happening within 1 sec of it happening.  Other apps we've used can have a several second delay.  My only complaint it that it isn't available on the Apple App Store and therefore we can't use it on all of our devices.,user_experience

Maybe if there was a spectrum live tv application this app wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t even be necessary but amazon seems to be slacking off on a lot of industrial moves for their company. Can not access Apple Music and Spotify functions very badly if not recognizing the voice. Using user data to improve quality of use should actually improve quality of work instead of still having issues.",issue

Fly Dragonfly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect mirror of my phone  screen,Extremely easy to use. I wanted to share my liked videos from tik tok with everyone in the room and I whimsically downloaded this app and purchased it before reading any reviews or knowing that it would work on my phone while also being compatible with my television and it was an epic time because it was fast and easy to use and went from tiny wondow to big screen in a matter of minutes. I recommend this app.,user_experience
Zane Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a good job if your wanting to mirror your iphone to your Fire Tv.,I would have to say that this app worked pretty well although I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t like how much lag there was between my phone and my tv. I used the screen mirroring app to watch the Monster Energy Nascar Cup Series race at Talladega. The picture Quality wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t horrible but I was honestly a little disappointed but I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think it had anything to do with the app if anything it was prob my internet connection but I think thatÃ¢â¬â¢s just the way things are.. All things considered I would recommend this app to anyone for sure itÃ¢â¬â¢s very easy to use and it did what I wanted.

Also, most Appstore apps and games sold on the TV were ridiculous (TV OS too weak to play anything complex?) sideloading Google Play to my TV was a hopeless task and every article author and group commenter brought it all back to buying Chromecast for another $30+ and maybe it would work and maybe it wouldn't.  Now, you have to buy the $5 upgrade to get rid of the ads which would ruin gaming and movie-watching and you have to uybay it from Ooglegay Ayplay, but I'm hoping it's worth it.

This is the first one that literally mirrors your phone screen.  ChromeCast  works for things that have casing ability but not showing movies and pictures on your phone.

The Ã¢â¬Åfree trialÃ¢â¬ï¿½ is actually only about five minutes long, which wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t enough time to test the sound. (I am actually not clear whether you CAN test the sound in the trial, because thatÃ¢â¬â¢s how quickly it went by.) So I foolishly paid the $9.99 for the full version. Did the sound work then? IÃ¢â¬â¢ll never know! Because once I input the activation code, I could no longer get the screen to even mirror. Just the same error over and over again.

Sam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Get this if you enjoy being frustrated and miserable,"If you're looking to seamlessly mirror content from other devices to your TV to follow along exercise/dance videos, learn a new skill, or enjoy general entertainment on the big screen...this product isn't for you.However, if you would like to be constantly dissatisfied or disappointed, you've come to the right place! Enjoy the frequent buffering and frame skipping of an inferior product that will never be mentioned in the same breath of a ChromeCast, Apple TV, or Firestick. But who values reliability and quality anyways? Being constant is dull. AirBeam TV keeps things FRESH by spontaneously throwing in wrenches into your streamed content. This app will take your favorite videos and movies, and mindlessly chop-and-screw it until it devolves into a hot/disheveled mess that once resembled your original content. But hey, everyone loves a good remix. Remixes are awesome and always better than the original!And if you enjoy horrible customer service, you can always count on AirBeam TV to not be there for you. If you had questions or comments about the product, but are repulsed by the thought of talking to a human being, AirBeam TV will gladly send you through an infinite loop of automated responses while deferring all blame to the user. It's not enough that I've restarted my computer and modem, closed all other extensions/applications, and checked the internet connection of my TV...I probably need to give up my left kidney and bladder too for my video content to be streamed without a hitch.AirBeam TV's connectivity strength and resolution may be inconsistent, but your disappointment with the product will remain constant over time!",issue
Paul A Dirmeyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Note: requires 2 downloads,"App works just fine. You need to download the app *both* for your FireTV or Fire Stick, as well as a .dmg file for your Mac.  Once both are installed and running, and both your Mac and FireTV are on the same wifi network, you will have an icon on the top bar on your Mac to connect your TV as a mirrored display.The Mac software is a free trial - runs for only about 5 minutes, so be ready to test-drive the things you want to mirror on your TV!  See if you like the results.  The purchase price for the Mac license is $9.99.For me there is about a 1-second lag between laptop and TV, which is fine for screen sharing with others in the room.  It's like teleconferencing software in that regard.  I have not used it yet for streaming video, but I have another app for that already.",user_experience
Richard C. Kelly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of time,"This app barely works. It does send a picture to the TV, but it's low quality, constantly freezes and lags behind the source by up to a minute, despite 100Mg/s internet connection.  Expect frustration.",issue

Matthew G Smentek,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Disappointing Ã¢â¬â Unusable for Video,This product is unusable for video streaming and barely usable for presentation.

I did not get it to connect after that.  I was able to get a refund for the App and I purchased a Lightning to HDMI cable which is more reliable albeit not as mobile.",issue
Anujeet Ghatak,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quite useless. DonÃ¢â¬â¢t waste your money,Its quite useless. It is cumbersome to use as it imitates screen recording on phone to mirror your screen. Thus the sound on phone does not go off automatically. There is a major lag in the cast... more than 5 seconds. Seems like the app has frozen to function every now and then due to the lag. The link keeps getting lost especially when on the chrome browser.,issue

It comes with a small bracket that can be fixed to the wall.  I use it to monitor my aquarium with discus fish and it is ideal.  Anywhere in your house that has a wireless connection can be used to place the camera and to view it over the internet.  I am able to check on my aquarium from my daughter's house.  One can move the camera remotely and I have found by experiment that it will zoom and focus remotely as well.  The colour picture is low quality which one would expect at that price, but it is adequate and also had infra red illumination at night with black and white picture. I have not used the filming or alarm at movement; or the addition of a memory card. It would certainly be useful for monitoring a child with sound from another room but would not record pictures in high enough quality for evidence.

They updated my purchase by double charging me for the same service then when I tried to cancel they told me it was cancelled and merged the charges and then continued to charge me a higher rate and service while simultaneously locking me out of my account. When I tried to login the webpage said my account was deactivated and they then proceeded to charge me for 2 more months. The entire time I was complaining to customer service with receipts and confirmations that my account was cancelled yet I was still being charged. Customer service was useless taking days to respond via email and the phone line disconnected during multiple calls and when I asked for a refund they just replied with ""you have access to service until next month enjoy"".

Shaun V.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful when/if you cancel your subscription.,"I had Fubo for the 2021/22 hockey season. It was a decent streaming service, but no longer became worth the price when they increased the cost dramatically. I accidently ""paused"" the service at the end of the hockey season instead of canceling it and during the off season I found cheaper ways to watch hockey (NESN) so I decided not to restart the service. Little did I know they would restart the service 6 months later without any notice and charged me $80. I called customer service and they said there was nothing they could do and refused any sort of refund. I'm sure they have the terms written and I honestly just screwed up when pausing instead of canceling, but restarting the service without some kind of notice and charging me 6 months later has certainly put me off the service permanently. A simple heads up email before restating the service and charging me would have been a much more honest business approach.",feature

I called customer service & they told me that there was no problem with their app & I should ""just watch something else"".  I'm sure you can guess how that comment went over with a diehard ND fan... The next day he tried again, only this time I could not even get the app to load.  So I called customer service AGAIN, except this time I was not nearly as friendly.  I told them that I wanted the subscription cancelled & my credit card information destroyed.  They told me that I had to request cancellation via email... WHICH I DID!!  Fast forward two weeks.  They charged my credit card for the subscription, which I cancelled over the phone AND by email.  I AGAIN called customer service and was told that I had not cancelled the subscription, but that they would ""see if they could refund the money"".  It wasn't ling before they told me that they would not refund the money AND I had to go through the cancellation process again.  I disputed the charge with my credit card and informed my credit card company that if they attempted to charge my card again it was fraud & I wanted to press charges.

Will not rewind or fast forward on recorded shows.  You can watch on your big screen if you stream from iPhone to tv.  It isn't perfect though.Nevertheless, I imagine the slugs who took the company public are laughing all the way to the bank.I suggest shorting the stock (which would have been a great idea earlier in the year as the stock price is hovering around $2 and some change), you may be able to make back some of your subscription fees!Lastly, I do feel sorry for the customer service reps.

The streaming quality itself was OK, with an occasional buffer, which was mildly disappointing. My biggest problem though was with the UI and the price. The price that fubo charges rivals Hulu Live and YouTube TV and yet the interface is not even close. Additionally, it seemed like the library was minuscule at best. Looking at the movie tab, for example, and it would show me maybe 10 options (all of which were live and nearing the end of the program). If you want to cancel it was difficult to find where to manage the subscription and it asks you if you are sure at least 3 times. I have used almost every streaming app and continue to use most of them as they each bring something to the table.

Rin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Deceptive and absolutely cancerous after installation.,"Not all fire tvs are the same... Some are super simple to cast to, others require third party applications.. The program doesn't tell you its just a free trial and will abruptly end the stream in the middle and tell you to subscribe to continue. It isn't even that great, it was lousy and kept buffering and lagging every few minutes.Now here's the real crap part, if you try to cast using Chromecast or anything that your tv USE TO BE ABLE TO DO without anything else... It intercepts these and tries to force you to use it for these as well!! Even if you literally can't because your not a paying customer! I tried to ignore it and manually selected the program I actually wanted to use...and then 30 minutes later it forced itself onto my tv interrupting my show by reopening itself! I had to completely uninstall the garbage because even when not running, ITS RUNNING.avoid at all costs. Overpriced, deceptive, malicious junk that tries to take over your tv!",issue
Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice upgrade to not so smart TV,My curved Samsung TV does not have AirPlay. Buying a fire stick and downloading this app allowed me to export sound and video from my MacBook Air. Video quality is decent but audio lags terribly. I export video only and use Bluetooth instead for audio. Works like a charm with that arrangement. Connectivity is ok; sometimes it takes a while to identify available devices on the network. The software on my Boot Camp windows 10 partition sometimes crashes. Unfortunately this software is subscription based (yearly). This was a nice workaround to upgrade my TV connectivity capabilities. Thank you to person who posted this idea in a forum somewhere (clever).,issue

Paula-Gene,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely horrible interface and regular crashing,"I have had this service for over 8 months.  In that time, the amount of recorded shows that had technical difficulties and crashed without recording the rest of the episode or having to start all over and find where it crashed is substantial.  And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.  The frustration level with this service is way beyond what its worth at one of the highest price points of all streaming services.  I highly recommend anyone who's considering this to just move on to the next service on your list.  This one is terrible.",issue

The streaming quality itself was OK, with an occasional buffer, which was mildly disappointing. My biggest problem though was with the UI and the price. The price that fubo charges rivals Hulu Live and YouTube TV and yet the interface is not even close. Additionally, it seemed like the library was minuscule at best. Looking at the movie tab, for example, and it would show me maybe 10 options (all of which were live and nearing the end of the program). If you want to cancel it was difficult to find where to manage the subscription and it asks you if you are sure at least 3 times. I have used almost every streaming app and continue to use most of them as they each bring something to the table.

Because when you cancel your subscription, Fubo locks you out immediately. So much for a free trial. You only get a free week if they get to keep your subscription intact. BOGUS MAN! Nobody does that. I mean like literally NOBODY else does that. I wanted to try this service without being stuck paying the extremely high subscription. I wanted to TRY the service. Fubo has no interest in me trying it. They want me to pay. So what if the first week is free - they want the big money. So they can suck it. And suck it hard. I will never try Fubo ever again. My 2 minute experience was woeful enough, but it was long enough to see how they run their business. Jackass mofos. 720p laughin my buttocks off.The stupid thing is, I am trying really hard to find a solution to cutting the cable company cord. I've been trying various things and keep coming up with the stiff end of these provider's business practices. Add Fubo to that list. I'm probably gonna have to end up with YouTube TV which literally makes me wanna cry.  I am willing to pay a monthly fee, but I literally HATE TV SHOWS! All I want is access to sports, without having 14 different subscriptions. Oh well. Sports bar. Friend's house. Pirate site hahahahahaha. Surely in a few more years there will be valid solutions for sports fans. Fubo will certainly never get my money.",feature

Paula-Gene,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely horrible interface and regular crashing,"I have had this service for over 8 months.  In that time, the amount of recorded shows that had technical difficulties and crashed without recording the rest of the episode or having to start all over and find where it crashed is substantial.  And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.  The frustration level with this service is way beyond what its worth at one of the highest price points of all streaming services.  I highly recommend anyone who's considering this to just move on to the next service on your list.  This one is terrible.",feature
WES,1.0 out of 5 stars,"FuboTv stinks, will not but again.","Streaming stutter, and it will not allow you to use your VPN service.  Hard time trying to reconnect to service after a system failure.

They only give you the option to unsubscribe by calling on the phone, but on the call they filter you and they do not answer you easily, days go by and they do not answer you, even if they tell you that in just 10' they will do it, they pass 30/40/60 min and you get bored and cut you cut.
